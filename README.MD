# OAuth 2.0 style 
This is a simple example of how to create a simple API that responds and authorizes access by validating a (static) bearer token following the OAauth 2.0 standard (but without using an OAuth server). I also attach an example of how to send a request to this API.

`This code is only recommended for applications where only 1 recognized client` must access the API (since the Bearer is static). For this reason, the use of an OAuth 2.0 server is not necessary (since no users must be managed).

`[SimPIL are a series of ultra-simple examples of how to perform different operations with code. Uncomplicated.]`

## Install
Just clone the repository and use 'index.php' as your api endpoint header. See 'check.php' to see how to send a request with Bearer authorization to this API.

### About security layer
Note that your endpoint must be run on a secure server.
